\begin{abstract}
Modern operational teams face a critical gap between incident detection and actionable comprehension. While single-agent large language models (LLMs) can summarize incidents quickly, we demonstrate they produce vague, unusable recommendations 98.3\% of the time. Through 348 controlled trials using a reproducible containerized framework (MyAntFarm.ai), we show that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Multi-agent systems achieve 100\% actionable recommendation rate compared to 1.7\% for single-agent approaches, with 80$\times$ improvement in action specificity and 140$\times$ improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, making them production-ready, while single-agent outputs remain inconsistent and largely unusable. These findings establish that the primary value of multi-agent orchestration lies not in speed (both systems achieve $\sim$40s latency) but in deterministic, high-quality decision support essential for time-critical operational contexts.

\section{Introduction}

High-volume telemetry arrives in seconds during production incidents, but \textit{actionable narrative}---what is broken, why, and what to do---often emerges minutes later through manual analysis. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate this process, yet preliminary deployments reveal a critical limitation: single-agent LLMs generate superficial summaries without specific, executable guidance.

We hypothesize that multi-agent orchestration---coordinating specialized LLM agents for diagnosis, planning, and risk assessment---can bridge the gap between \textit{detection} and \textit{actionable comprehension}. To test this hypothesis, we present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible experimental framework enabling controlled comparison of three conditions: (C1) manual dashboard analysis baseline, (C2) single-agent copilot, and (C3) multi-agent orchestration.

\subsection{Key Contributions}

Through 348 simulation trials, we demonstrate:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Deterministic quality advantage}: Multi-agent systems achieve 100\% actionable recommendation rate (Decision Quality $>$ 0.5) versus 1.7\% for single-agent systems, with zero variance across all trials.
    \item \textbf{Specificity improvement}: 80$\times$ higher action specificity---multi-agent generates commands like ``rollback auth-service to v2.3.0'' versus single-agent's ``investigate recent changes.''
    \item \textbf{Correctness improvement}: 140$\times$ better alignment with ground truth solutions, measured via token overlap with validated incident resolutions.
    \item \textbf{Production readiness}: Zero quality variance in multi-agent systems enables SLA commitments, unlike single-agent's unpredictable outputs.
    \item \textbf{Novel evaluation framework}: We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a multi-dimensional metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness---properties essential for production deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address.
\end{itemize}

Critically, both single-agent and multi-agent systems achieve similar comprehension latency ($\sim$40s after outlier removal). The \textit{architectural value lies in quality and determinism}, not speed. This finding reframes multi-agent orchestration as essential for production deployment rather than a performance optimization.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{LLMs in Operational Intelligence}

Recent advances in large language models have transformed AI for IT Operations (AIOps)~\cite{zhang2025aiops}, with deep learning approaches showing particular promise for anomaly detection~\cite{darban2024deep}. However, these studies focus on \textit{detection} rather than \textit{actionable response}. Our work addresses the gap between identifying issues and generating executable remediation steps.

\subsection{Multi-Agent LLM Systems}

Multi-agent approaches have shown promise in software engineering~\cite{qian2023chatdev}, scientific reasoning~\cite{qian2024scaling}, and collaborative problem-solving~\cite{park2023generative}. These systems distribute reasoning across specialized agents, improving both quality and explainability. We extend this paradigm to operational intelligence, where time-critical decisions demand both speed and reliability.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics for LLM Systems}
Prior LLM evaluation metrics focus on linguistic properties. BERTScore~\cite{zhang2020bertscore} uses contextual embeddings 
to measure semantic similarity, correlating better with human judgments than n-gram metrics. However, semantic similarity does not capture \textit{operational actionability}. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a multi-dimensional metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness---critical properties for production deployment that existing metrics do not address.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Simulation Framework}

MyAntFarm.ai consists of five containerized microservices orchestrated via Docker Compose:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{LLM Backend}: Ollama (v0.1.32) serving TinyLlama (1B parameters, 4-bit quantized) via HTTP API
    \item \textbf{Copilot (C2)}: FastAPI service implementing single-agent summarization
    \item \textbf{MultiAgent (C3)}: Coordinator dispatching to specialized agents (diagnosis, planning, risk assessment)
    \item \textbf{Evaluator}: Controller executing 116 trials per condition with rate limiting (10 calls/min)
    \item \textbf{Analyzer}: Post-processing pipeline computing metrics and statistical tests
\end{enumerate}

All services share persistent volumes ensuring deterministic reproduction across environments. Source code, Docker configurations, and trial outputs are available at: \url{https://github.com/Phildram1/myantfarm-ai}

\subsection{Experimental Conditions}

Three conditions were evaluated under identical incident contexts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{C1 (Baseline)}: Simulated manual dashboard analysis. Timing based on practitioner estimates ($\mu = 120$s, $\sigma = 6.5$s) with Gaussian jitter. No structured action output.
    \item \textbf{C2 (Single-Agent)}: Copilot receives incident telemetry, generates summary and actions. Timing measured from API call to response completion.
    \item \textbf{C3 (Multi-Agent)}: Coordinator dispatches context to specialized agents, aggregates outputs, produces structured brief. Timing measured end-to-end including orchestration overhead.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Transparency note}: C1 timing is simulated based on literature estimates~\cite{beyer2016site}, not empirically measured. It serves as a reference baseline. C2 and C3 timings reflect actual measured system latency.

\subsection{Agent Definitions}

\textbf{Critical distinction}: In this study, an ``agent'' is a single LLM inference call with a specialized prompt, not a separate model or API. All agents use the same TinyLlama (1B) backend. The architectural difference between C2 and C3 is \textit{prompt decomposition and sequential composition}, not model diversity.

\subsubsection{Single-Agent (C2)}

The single-agent condition issues \textit{one} LLM inference call with a complex, multi-objective prompt requesting root cause diagnosis, remediation planning, and risk assessment simultaneously. The prompt structure:

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\small\ttfamily, breaklines=true]
You are an incident responder. Given the following telemetry:

Service: auth-service v2.4.0
Error rate: 45% on /api/v1/login, /api/v1/token/refresh
Database: 85% connection pool utilization
Recent changes: Deployment v2.4.0 at 14:23 UTC

Provide:
1. Root cause diagnosis
2. Recommended remediation actions (with specific commands)
3. Risk assessment of proposed actions
\end{lstlisting}

The LLM generates a single unstructured text response attempting to address all objectives. No iteration or refinement occurs.

\subsubsection{Multi-Agent (C3)}

The multi-agent condition decomposes incident analysis into three sequential LLM calls, each with a focused, single-objective prompt:

\textbf{Agent 1 (Diagnosis Specialist)}: Analyzes telemetry to identify root cause.

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\small\ttfamily, breaklines=true]
You are a diagnostic specialist. Analyze the following telemetry and identify the root cause of the incident:

Service: auth-service v2.4.0
Error rate: 45% on /api/v1/login
Database: 85% connection pool utilization
Recent deployment: v2.4.0 at 14:23 UTC

What is the root cause?
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Agent 2 (Remediation Planner)}: Given the diagnosed root cause, generates specific remediation steps.

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\small\ttfamily, breaklines=true]
You are a remediation planner. Given this root cause:

[Agent 1 output: "Database connection pool exhaustion due to connection leak in v2.4.0"]

Create step-by-step remediation actions with:
- Specific commands (e.g., kubectl, systemctl)
- Version numbers
- Configuration parameters

Be concrete and actionable.
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Agent 3 (Risk Assessor)}: Evaluates risks of proposed actions.

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\small\ttfamily, breaklines=true]
You are a risk assessor. Evaluate the risks of these proposed actions:

[Agent 2 output: "1. Rollback auth-service to v2.3.0 using kubectl rollout undo..."]

Context:
- Production environment
- Peak traffic hours
- Previous stable version: v2.3.0 (deployed 48h ago)

Assess risks and suggest mitigations.
\end{lstlisting}

A coordinator (non-LLM orchestration logic) aggregates the three agent outputs into a structured incident brief containing root cause, recommended actions, and risk assessment.

\textbf{Sequential composition}: Agent 2 receives Agent 1's output as input. Agent 3 receives Agent 2's output. This creates a dependency chain enabling specialization while maintaining context flow.

\subsection{Incident Scenario}

All 348 trials used identical context to isolate orchestration effects from scenario variability:

\textbf{Scenario}: Authentication service regression post-deployment
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Symptoms}: 45\% error rate on \texttt{/api/v1/login}, \texttt{/api/v1/token/refresh}
    \item \textbf{Context}: Deployment v2.4.0 (previous stable: v2.3.0)
    \item \textbf{Telemetry}: Database connections at 85\% capacity, p95 response time degraded 13$\times$
    \item \textbf{Ground Truth}: Rollback auth-service to v2.3.0, verify DB connection pool configuration
\end{itemize}

Multi-scenario validation is planned for Phase 2.

\subsection{Metrics}

\subsubsection{Time to Usable Understanding ($T_{2U}$)}

$T_{2U}$ captures latency from incident onset to actionable output:

\begin{equation}
T_{2U}^{(c)} = \frac{1}{N_c} \sum_{i=1}^{N_c} (t_{\text{understanding},i} - t_{\text{incident},i})
\end{equation}

where $t_{\text{incident},i}$ is trial start timestamp and $t_{\text{understanding},i}$ is the timestamp when the system produces its first coherent summary with actionable recommendations.

\textbf{Definition of ``actionable output''}: For C2 and C3, the first complete API response containing both summary text and structured action list. For C1 (baseline), the simulated time when a human analyst would complete dashboard review and formulate initial response.

\textbf{Measurement}: Captured via high-resolution system timestamps (microsecond precision) at API request initiation and response completion. Lower $T_{2U}$ indicates faster comprehension.

\textbf{Relation to industry metrics}: $T_{2U}$ is conceptually related to Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR), but focuses specifically on the \textit{comprehension phase}---the gap between detection and human understanding sufficient to begin remediation. This is a novel contribution as existing metrics do not isolate this phase.

\subsubsection{Decision Quality (DQ)}

DQ measures actionability through three dimensions. This is a \textbf{novel metric framework} developed for this study, as existing LLM evaluation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore) focus on linguistic similarity rather than operational utility.

\begin{equation}
DQ_i = \alpha \cdot V_i + \beta \cdot S_i + \gamma \cdot R_i
\end{equation}

where $\alpha = 0.40$, $\beta = 0.30$, $\gamma = 0.30$ (weights sum to 1.0). Weights were chosen to prioritize validity (feasibility) over specificity and correctness, reflecting production constraints where invalid actions are more harmful than vague ones.

\textbf{Component definitions}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Validity} ($V_i \in [0,1]$): Ratio of technically feasible actions
    \begin{equation}
    V_i = \frac{A_{\text{valid},i}}{A_{\text{total},i}}
    \end{equation}
    
    Actions are marked invalid if they contain impossible values (e.g., ``CPU at 500\%''), contradictory directives (e.g., ``restart and rollback simultaneously''), or syntactically malformed commands. In our evaluation, all systems produced 100\% valid actions ($V_i = 1.0$ across all trials).
    
    \item \textbf{Specificity} ($S_i \in [0,1]$): Presence of concrete identifiers enabling immediate execution. Scored via automated regex pattern matching on each action:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 1.0: Contains specific identifiers (e.g., version numbers matching \texttt{v?\textbackslash d+\textbackslash.\textbackslash d+\textbackslash.\textbackslash d+}, exact commands like \texttt{kubectl rollout undo})
        \item 0.67: Names services without versions (e.g., ``rollback auth-service'')
        \item 0.33: Generic categories only (e.g., ``rollback recent deployment'')
        \item 0.0: Vague directives (e.g., ``check logs'', ``investigate'')
    \end{itemize}
    
    Final specificity is the mean across all actions in trial $i$. Pattern matching regexes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Version numbers: \texttt{v?\textbackslash d+\textbackslash.\textbackslash d+(\textbackslash.\textbackslash d+)?}
        \item Commands: \texttt{kubectl|docker|systemctl|aws|gcloud}
        \item Services: \texttt{auth|payment|api|database}-specific names
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Correctness} ($R_i \in [0,1]$): Alignment with ground truth incident resolution via token overlap:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 1.0: $\geq$70\% token overlap with ground truth (matches known solution)
        \item 0.75: 50--69\% overlap (addresses root cause, alternative approach)
        \item 0.50: 30--49\% overlap (addresses symptom, not cause)
        \item 0.25: 10--29\% overlap (tangentially related)
        \item 0.0: $<$10\% overlap (unrelated or harmful)
    \end{itemize}
    
    Token overlap calculation:
    \begin{equation}
    \text{overlap\_ratio} = \frac{|\text{tokens}(\text{action}) \cap \text{tokens}(\text{ground\_truth})|}{|\text{tokens}(\text{ground\_truth})|}
    \end{equation}
    
    where tokens are lowercased, whitespace-split words. Ground truth for this scenario: ``rollback auth-service deployment to v2.3.0 verify database connection pool''.
    
    Final correctness is the mean across all actions in trial $i$.
\end{itemize}

Aggregate DQ per condition:
\begin{equation}
DQ^{(c)} = \frac{1}{N_c} \sum_{i=1}^{N_c} DQ_i
\end{equation}

Higher DQ indicates more actionable, specific, and correct recommendations. All 348 trials were scored using the automated DQScorer implementation (available at \texttt{src/scoring/dq\_scorer\_v2.py}), ensuring consistency and eliminating human bias.

\textbf{Threshold for actionability}: We define recommendations as ``actionable'' when $DQ > 0.5$, indicating sufficient specificity and correctness for operator execution. This threshold was chosen conservatively; recommendations scoring 0.5 typically contain at least one version-specific action with moderate ground truth alignment.

\textbf{Limitations of automated scoring}: DQ scores capture syntactic properties (presence of version numbers, token overlap) but not semantic understanding. A recommendation scoring 0.7 may be technically correct but contextually inappropriate. Phase 2 will validate automated scores against human expert ratings to establish inter-rater reliability.

\subsection{Statistical Validation}

Post-hoc statistical testing applied to all results:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{One-way ANOVA}: Test null hypothesis $H_0: \mu_{C1} = \mu_{C2} = \mu_{C3}$ for both $T_{2U}$ and DQ
    \item \textbf{Pairwise t-tests}: All condition pairs with Bonferroni correction ($\alpha = 0.05/3 = 0.0167$)
    \item \textbf{Confidence intervals}: 95\% CI computed for each condition mean
    \item \textbf{Effect sizes}: Cohen's $d$ calculated for primary comparisons
\end{enumerate}

Software: scipy.stats (v1.11.3), pandas (v2.1.1). All statistical tests executed automatically via \texttt{src/analysis/statistical\_tests.py}.

\subsection{Reproducibility}

All code, Docker configurations, and trial outputs available at: \url{https://github.com/Phildram1/myantfarm-ai}

\textbf{Deterministic execution}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Random seed: 42 (set in evaluator configuration)
    \item LLM temperature: 0.7 (fixed across all trials)
    \item Model: TinyLlama 1.1B parameters, 4-bit quantization
    \item Ollama version: 0.1.32
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Expected runtime}: 25--30 minutes for full 348-trial evaluation on 16GB RAM system with CPU inference.

\section{Results}

We executed 348 trials (116 per condition) using identical incident context. Results presented here exclude one C2 outlier (Trial C2\_028: 4009s, suspected LLM deadlock) to enable fair comparison. Full dataset including outlier analysis provided in supplementary materials at GitHub repository.

\subsection{Primary Findings}

Table~\ref{tab:main-results} presents aggregated metrics. Multi-agent orchestration (C3) demonstrates superior decision quality with deterministic consistency.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Aggregated Performance Metrics (116 Trials Per Condition, Outlier Removed)}
\label{tab:main-results}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Condition} & \textbf{Mean $T_{2U}$} & \textbf{Std $T_{2U}$} & \textbf{Mean DQ} & \textbf{Std DQ} & \textbf{Actions} \\
                   & (s) & (s) & & & (mean) \\
\midrule
C1 (Baseline)      & 120.39 & 5.92  & 0.000 & 0.000 & 0.00 \\
C2 (Single-Agent)  & 41.61  & 17.31 & 0.403 & 0.023 & 2.01 \\
C3 (Multi-Agent)   & 40.31  & 17.32 & 0.692 & 0.000 & 3.00 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key observations}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Marginal latency difference}: C2 and C3 achieve similar $T_{2U}$ (41.61s vs 40.31s, 3.2\% difference). Speed is \textit{not} the differentiator.
    \item \textbf{Substantial quality advantage}: C3 achieves 71.7\% higher DQ than C2 (0.692 vs 0.403).
    \item \textbf{Zero variance in C3}: Std DQ $\approx$ 0 indicates completely deterministic quality---critical for production deployment.
    \item \textbf{Unreliable C2 quality}: Std DQ = 0.023 (5.7\% coefficient of variation) indicates inconsistent outputs.
\end{itemize}

All pairwise comparisons significant at $\alpha = 0.0167$ (Bonferroni corrected). ANOVA for DQ: $F(2, 345) = 18472.3$, $p < 0.001$.

\subsection{Decision Quality Component Analysis}

Table~\ref{tab:dq-components} decomposes DQ into validity, specificity, and correctness components, revealing where multi-agent orchestration provides value.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Decision Quality Component Breakdown}
\label{tab:dq-components}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Component} & \textbf{C2 Mean} & \textbf{C3 Mean} & \textbf{Improvement} \\
\midrule
Validity    & 1.000 $\pm$ 0.000 & 1.000 $\pm$ 0.000 & --- \\
Specificity & 0.007 $\pm$ 0.052 & 0.557 $\pm$ 0.000 & \textbf{80$\times$} \\
Correctness & 0.003 $\pm$ 0.026 & 0.417 $\pm$ 0.000 & \textbf{140$\times$} \\
\midrule
Overall DQ  & 0.403 $\pm$ 0.023 & 0.692 $\pm$ 0.000 & \textbf{71.7\%} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key findings}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Validity parity}: Both systems generate technically feasible actions (Validity = 1.0).
    \item \textbf{Specificity failure in C2}: Mean specificity of 0.007 indicates nearly all C2 actions are vague (e.g., ``investigate'', ``check logs'').
    \item \textbf{Correctness failure in C2}: Mean correctness of 0.003 indicates C2 actions rarely align with ground truth solutions.
    \item \textbf{C3 determinism}: Zero variance in specificity and correctness---multi-agent systems produce identical-quality outputs across all trials.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Actionability Analysis}

We define \textit{actionable} recommendations as DQ $> 0.5$ (sufficiently specific and correct for operator execution). Table~\ref{tab:actionability} shows dramatic differences in actionability rates.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{RECOMMENDATION ACTIONABILITY RATES}
\label{tab:actionability}
\begin{threeparttable}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\hline
Metric & C2 & C3 \\
\hline
Trials with DQ $>$ 0.5 (Good) & 2/115\tnote{*} (1.7\%) & 116/116 (100\%) \\
Trials with DQ $<$ 0.3 (Poor) & 0/115 (0\%) & 0/116 (0\%) \\
Consistent Quality & No & Yes \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tablenotes}
\small
\item[*] C2 shows 115 trials after removing one catastrophic outlier (4009s); see Section IV.E
\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

\textbf{Critical finding}: Single-agent systems produce actionable recommendations only 1.7\% of the time, while multi-agent systems achieve 100\% actionability with zero variance. This represents a \textit{qualitative difference in production readiness}, not merely quantitative improvement.

\subsection{Example Outputs}

Table~\ref{tab:example-outputs} contrasts representative outputs from C2 and C3, illustrating the specificity gap.

\begin{table*}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Representative System Outputs}
\label{tab:example-outputs}
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.15\textwidth}p{0.35\textwidth}p{0.35\textwidth}@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{C2 (Single-Agent)} & \textbf{C3 (Multi-Agent)} \\
\midrule
Actions Generated & 
\texttt{- Investigate recent changes} \newline
\texttt{- Review system metrics} & 
\texttt{- Rollback auth-service to v2.3.0 using kubectl rollout undo} \newline
\texttt{- Verify database connection pool max\_connections setting} \newline
\texttt{- Monitor error rates for 5 minutes post-rollback} \\
\midrule
DQ Score & 0.400 & 0.692 \\
Specificity & 0.0 (generic) & 0.56 (version-specific command) \\
Correctness & 0.0 (no alignment) & 0.42 (matches ground truth) \\
Actionable? & \textbf{No} & \textbf{Yes} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

C2 outputs are too vague for immediate execution, requiring further manual investigation. C3 outputs provide executable commands, versions, and validation steps---enabling immediate remediation.

\subsection{Outlier Analysis}

One C2 trial (C2\_028) exhibited catastrophic latency (4009s, $\sim$67 minutes), likely due to LLM inference deadlock. This single trial inflated C2's original standard deviation from 17.31s to 368.80s. \textbf{Critically, no such failures occurred in C3}, suggesting multi-agent orchestration provides implicit fault tolerance through task decomposition.

After outlier removal, variance metrics converge:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Original C2/C3 variance ratio}: 21.3$\times$ (C2 Std = 368.80s, C3 Std = 17.32s)
    \item \textbf{Cleaned C2/C3 variance ratio}: 1.0$\times$ (C2 Std = 17.31s, C3 Std = 17.32s)
\end{itemize}

This indicates similar \textit{latency stability} once catastrophic failures are excluded. However, \textit{quality variance} remains fundamentally different: C2 exhibits 5.7\% quality coefficient of variation while C3 maintains zero variance.

\subsection{Statistical Significance}

All pairwise DQ comparisons significant at $\alpha = 0.0167$ (Bonferroni corrected):
\begin{itemize}
    \item C1 vs C2: $t(230) = -187.4$, $p < 0.001$, Cohen's $d = 24.9$ (very large effect)
    \item C1 vs C3: $t(230) = -320.8$, $p < 0.001$, Cohen's $d = 42.6$ (very large effect)
    \item C2 vs C3: $t(230) = -137.2$, $p < 0.001$, Cohen's $d = 18.2$ (very large effect)
\end{itemize}

Effect sizes far exceed conventional thresholds for ``large'' effects (Cohen's $d > 0.8$), indicating robust, practically significant differences.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Primary Finding: Quality, Not Speed}

Our central finding challenges prevailing assumptions about multi-agent LLM systems. After removing catastrophic outliers, single-agent (C2) and multi-agent (C3) systems achieve nearly identical comprehension latency (41.61s vs 40.31s, 3.2\% difference). \textbf{The architectural value lies entirely in decision quality and determinism}, not speed.

This reframes multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a \textit{production-readiness requirement}. Single-agent systems are fast but generate vague, inconsistent recommendations 98.3\% of the time. Multi-agent systems provide deterministic, actionable guidance 100\% of the time---a qualitative difference essential for operational deployment.

\subsection{Implications for Production Deployment}

The 100\% actionability rate and zero quality variance of C3 enable concrete service-level agreements (SLAs). A system with DQ = 0.692 $\pm$ 0.000 can commit to consistent recommendation quality. In contrast, C2's DQ = 0.403 $\pm$ 0.023 (5.7\% coefficient of variation) provides no basis for quality guarantees.

For time-critical incidents where incorrect or vague guidance extends Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR), the 71.7\% quality improvement justifies minimal orchestration overhead. Operators require specific actions (``rollback to v2.3.0'') rather than generic suggestions (``investigate changes'').

\textbf{ROI estimation}: For a team handling 100 incidents/month with \$200/hour on-call labor, reducing interpretation time from 5 minutes (single-agent) to 0 minutes (multi-agent) yields approximately \$70,000/year in labor savings plus additional MTTR reduction value.

\subsection{Architectural Sources of Quality Advantage}

Multi-agent quality improvements derive from four mechanisms:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Task specialization}: Dedicated diagnosis, planning, and risk agents focus on distinct aspects, improving depth over single-agent breadth. Each agent's prompt is simpler, reducing conflicting objectives.
    \item \textbf{Implicit fault tolerance}: Agent failures are isolated; coordinator proceeds with partial results. C2's catastrophic timeout (4009s) did not occur inC3 across 116 trials, suggesting orchestration prevents cascading failures.
\item \textbf{Prompt engineering benefit}: Shorter, specialized prompts (50-100 tokens) reduce generation variance compared to C2's complex, multi-objective prompt (200+ tokens). LLMs perform better on focused tasks.
\item \textbf{Structured output enforcement}: Sequential composition naturally produces structured outputs (root cause → actions → risk), whereas C2 generates unstructured text requiring post-processing.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Novelty of Decision Quality Metric}
Existing LLM evaluation metrics focus on linguistic properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{BLEU, ROUGE}: N-gram overlap with reference text
\item \textbf{BERTScore}: Semantic similarity via embeddings
\item \textbf{Human evaluation}: Coherence, fluency, relevance
\end{itemize}
These metrics do not capture \textit{operational actionability}---whether recommendations enable immediate execution. Our DQ framework addresses this gap by measuring:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Validity}: Technical feasibility (can this be executed?)
\item \textbf{Specificity}: Presence of identifiers (does this contain versions, commands?)
\item \textbf{Correctness}: Alignment with solution (does this solve the problem?)
\end{itemize}
DQ prioritizes properties critical for production deployment: an operator can execute a DQ=0.7 recommendation immediately, whereas BLEU=0.8 text may be linguistically coherent but operationally useless.
\textbf{Validation}: Phase 2 will establish inter-rater reliability by having 10-15 SRE practitioners rate 50 trials, comparing human DQ scores against automated scores.
\subsection{Limitations}
\subsubsection{Single Scenario}
All trials used identical authentication service incident context. Generalization across incident classes (database outages, network partitions, resource exhaustion) requires validation. However, the 80$×\times$ specificity and 140$×\times$ correctness improvements suggest architectural benefits that transcend specific scenarios.

\textbf{Future work}: Phase 2 will evaluate 5+ diverse scenarios (database connection pool exhaustion, CDN cache poisoning, memory leaks, network partitions, third-party API rate limiting) to establish cross-scenario generalization.
\subsubsection{Simulated Baseline}
C1 timing is simulated based on practitioner estimates, not empirically measured. While this provides reference context, it does not affect C2/C3 comparisons---the primary contribution of this work. C1 serves to contextualize LLM-assisted approaches against manual analysis, not as a rigorous benchmark.
\subsubsection{Automated Scoring Without Human Validation}
DQ scores are computed algorithmically without human validation. The scoring rubric prioritizes specificity (version numbers, commands) and correctness (token overlap with ground truth), which correlate with operator utility but may not capture all dimensions of recommendation quality.
\textbf{Limitations of token overlap}: A recommendation may score 0.7 correctness by matching keywords but suggest an inappropriate solution for the operational context (e.g., rollback during peak traffic without gradual migration).
\textbf{Mitigation strategy}: Phase 2 human validation study will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Recruit 10-15 SRE practitioners from diverse organizations
    \item Have experts rate 50 randomly sampled trials (blind to condition)
    \item Calculate inter-rater reliability (Krippendorff's $\alpha > 0.70$ target)
    \item Correlate human ratings with automated DQ scores
    \item Refine scoring rubric based on discrepancies
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model Selection and Generalization}
We used TinyLlama (1B parameters) for reproducibility and resource constraints. Larger models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4) may improve absolute DQ scores for both conditions.
\textbf{Expected impact}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Absolute DQ scores}: Likely increase for both C2 and C3 (e.g., C2: 0.40 → 0.60, C3: 0.69 → 0.85)
\item \textbf{Relative improvement}: Gap may narrow (71% → 40%) as larger models produce more specific outputs even with complex prompts
\item \textbf{Zero variance property}: Should persist in C3 (structural property of deterministic orchestration)
\item \textbf{100\% actionability}: Expected to remain in C3 (task specialization benefit is model-agnostic)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Hypothesis}: Architectural advantages (task specialization, fault isolation, zero variance) derive from orchestration design rather than model capabilities, and should persist across model scales. However, the \textit{magnitude} of improvement may decrease with more capable models.
\textbf{Future work}: Validate findings with Llama 3.1 70B and GPT-4 to quantify model size effects on relative improvement.
\subsubsection{Deterministic Environment}
Evaluation occurred in controlled Docker environment with fixed prompts, temperature, and seed. Real-world deployments encounter:
\begin{itemize}
\item Diverse telemetry formats (Datadog, Splunk, Prometheus)
\item Partial or incomplete data
\item Operator interruptions and clarification requests
\item Time-sensitive escalations
\end{itemize}
However, the \textit{relative} quality advantage of multi-agent systems should generalize, as it derives from architectural properties (task decomposition, sequential composition) rather than environmental specifics.
\textbf{Production deployment considerations}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Integrate with observability platforms via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
\item Add fallback mechanisms for agent failures
\item Implement human-in-the-loop for low-confidence recommendations (DQ $<$ 0.5)
\item Log all recommendations for post-incident review
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Comparison to Prior Work}
Recent work on LLM-based incident response~\cite{darban2024deep,lyu2021empirical} focuses on detection and summarization. Our contribution demonstrates that \textit{actionable response}---not merely detection---requires multi-agent orchestration. The 1.7% actionability rate of single-agent systems suggests prior approaches may overestimate deployment readiness.

Multi-agent systems consistently demonstrate quality improvements through task specialization. ChatDev~\cite{qian2023chatdev} 
pioneered specialized agents for software development, while subsequent work on scaling collaboration~\cite{qian2024scaling} 
extended these principles to complex topologies. However, prior work reports quality improvements without quantifying determinism 
or production readiness. Our zero-variance result (std DQ = 0.000) provides the first empirical basis for SLA commitments in 
multi-agent LLM systems.

RAG-based approaches~\cite{lyu2021empirical} improve context awareness by retrieving historical incidents, but do not address the structural limitations of single-agent prompting. RAG is \textit{complementary} to multi-agent orchestration: integrating RAG with C3 could further improve correctness by grounding recommendations in organizational precedent.
\subsection{Practical Applications}
While this study is theoretical (single scenario, simulated environment), the architectural insights have practical implications:
\subsubsection{Incident Response Automation}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Use case}: Deploy multi-agent system in shadow mode alongside human operators
\item \textbf{Implementation}: 2-4 week pilot with SRE team, logging recommendations without execution
\item \textbf{Expected outcome}: 50-70\% reduction in time spent interpreting vague AI suggestions
\item \textbf{Risk}: Requires validation on organization-specific incident types
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Runbook Generation}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Use case}: Generate incident-specific runbooks from historical data
\item \textbf{Implementation}: RAG integration with postmortem database

\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Junior Engineer Onboarding}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Use case}: Provide high-quality guidance during on-call training
\item \textbf{Implementation}: Multi-agent system as teaching tool, validated by senior engineers
\item \textbf{Expected outcome}: 30\% faster ramp-up to independent on-call readiness
\item \textbf{Risk}: Recommendations must be validated initially; avoid blind trust
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Decision Support (Not Automation)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Use case}: Present multi-agent output as suggestions requiring human approval
\item \textbf{Implementation}: UI showing recommendations with confidence scores (DQ)
\item \textbf{Expected outcome}: Operators execute recommendations after review, reducing cognitive load
\item \textbf{Risk}: Human remains in the loop for safety-critical decisions
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Deployment checklist before production use}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[□\square

\section{Conclusion}
Through 348 controlled trials, we demonstrate that multi-agent LLM orchestration achieves 100\% actionable recommendation quality compared to 1.7\% for single-agent systems, with $80×\times$ improvement in specificity and $140×\times$ improvement in correctness. Critically, both systems exhibit similar comprehension latency ($\sim$40s), establishing that \textit{architectural value lies in deterministic quality}, not speed.

The zero quality variance of multi-agent systems---producing identical DQ = 0.692 across all 116 trials---enables production deployment with SLA commitments. Single-agent systems, despite acceptable speed, generate vague, inconsistent recommendations unsuitable for operational use.
These findings reframe multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response. The MyAntFarm.ai framework provides a reproducible foundation for validating these results across incident scenarios, model scales, and human expert evaluations.
\textbf{Key takeaway}: Speed without quality is operationally useless. Multi-agent orchestration delivers the deterministic, actionable guidance essential for time-critical incident response.
